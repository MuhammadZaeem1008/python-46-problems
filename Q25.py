# In English, the present participle is formed by adding the suffix 足ing to the infinite form: go 足> going. A simple
# set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:
# 1. If the verb ends in e, drop the e and add ing (if not exception: be, see, flee, knee, etc.)
# 2. If the verb ends in ie, change ie to y and add ing
# 3. For words consisting of consonant足vowel足consonant, double the final letter before adding ing
# 4. By default just add ing
