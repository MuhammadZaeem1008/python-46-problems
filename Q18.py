# . A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once, for example: The
# quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Your task here is to write a function to check a sentence to see if it
# is a pangram or not.
def pangram(sent):
    str1=[]
    for  i in range(97,123):
        str1.append(chr(i))
    sent.lower()
    # print(sent)
    for i in sent:
        
        if i.isalpha() and i in str1:
            str1.remove(i)
    if str1==[]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
