# An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a
# new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly onceÍ¾ e.g., orchestra = carthorse. Using the word
# list at http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, write a program that finds the sets of words that
# share the same characters that contain the most words in them.
